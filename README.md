# pig game Project

Game for two people that consists of throwing the dice and adding points until reaching 100 points. Within each turn, the numbers obtained for each roll will be added in "CURRENT", but if the number 1 appears, the points of that current turn and the turn it self will automatically be lost. Before this happens, you can save the sum of the points obtained in a general sum, since it is the only way to ensure that you can add the points and reach 100 points to win.

This project was designed by my teacher Jonas Schmedtmann.
